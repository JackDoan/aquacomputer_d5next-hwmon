# d5next-hwmon

*A hwmon Linux kernel driver for exposing sensors of the Aquacomputer D5 Next watercooling pump.*

Supports reading coolant temperature, as well as speed, power, voltage and current of the pump and optionally attached fan. Being a standard `hwmon` driver, it provides readings via `sysfs`, which are easily accessible through `lm-sensors` as usual:
